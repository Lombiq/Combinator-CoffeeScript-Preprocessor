# Combinator CoffeeScript Preprocessor Readme



## Project Description

CoffeeScript preprocessor for the Combinator Orchard module (https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator/).


## Documentation

**The module is dependent on the [Combinator](https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator) Orchard module (needs at least Combinator 2.0), so make sure to install it first!**

This preprocessor hooks into Combinator and compiles included CoffeeScript files (.coffee files) into pure JavaScript.

The module's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/combinator-coffeescript-preprocessor](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/combinator-coffeescript-preprocessor) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator-CoffeeScript-Preprocessor](https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator-CoffeeScript-Preprocessor) (Git repository)

Bug reports, feature requests and comments are warmly welcome, **please do so via GitHub**.
Feel free to send pull requests too, no matter which source repository you choose for this purpose.
