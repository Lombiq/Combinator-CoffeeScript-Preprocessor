# Combinator CoffeeScript Preprocessor



## About

CoffeeScript preprocessor for the Combinator Orchard module (https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator/).


## Documentation

**The module is dependent on the [Combinator](https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator) Orchard module (needs at least Combinator 2.0), so make sure to install it first!**

This preprocessor hooks into Combinator and compiles included CoffeeScript files (.coffee files) into pure JavaScript.
